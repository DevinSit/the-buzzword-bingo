# Frontend

The Frontend service is the user-facing portion of the app. It serves the user a bingo grid with a predetermined set of buzzwords in a random layout. It also handles showing the current list of connected users as well as bingo winners.

This service was originally designed with web sockets to facilitate instanteous updates of the connected users/winners lists, but that functionality was stripped out in favour of regular old polling to enable deployment on GCP Cloud Run (in essence, serverless containers) for demo purposes.

**Note:** Just for context, this app was originally written in 2018, so you're not going to find any newer React features like hooks in here.
